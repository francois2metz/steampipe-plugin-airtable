# Table: {airtable_record}

Query data from Airtable tables. A table is automatically created to represent each Airtable table found in the configured `tables`.

For instance, if `tables` is set to `["Design Projects", "Tasks", "Clients"]`, then this plugin will create 3 tables:

- design_projects
- tasks
- clients

## Examples

### Get all IDs

```sql
select
  id
from
  design_projects;
```

### Get a record by ID

```sql
select
  created_time,
  fields
from
  design_projects
where
  id = 'recdTpx4c0kPPDTtf';
```

### Get the 5 last created rows

```sql
select
  id
from
  design_projects
order by
  created_time desc
limit
  5;
```

### Expand `Client` field to list clients associated with projects

```sql
select
  d.id as project_id,
  cid as client_id
from
  design_projects as d,
  jsonb_array_elements_text(d.fields -> 'Client') as cid;
```

### Get full information for each client associated with a project

```sql
select
  d.id as project_id,
  c.id as client_id,
  d.fields ->> 'Name' as project_name,
  c.fields ->> 'Name' as client_name,
  c.fields ->> 'About' as client_description
from
  design_projects as d,
  jsonb_array_elements_text(d.fields -> 'Client') as cid,
  clients as c
where
  c.id = cid;
```

### List projects using the [formula filter](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215)

```sql
select
  fields ->> 'Name' as name,
  fields ->> 'Kickoff date' as kickoff_date
from
  design_projects
where
  filter_formula = 'IS_AFTER({Kickoff date}, "2020-10-01")';
```
